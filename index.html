	<p class="abstractClass"style="font-size:20px" align="justify"> <b>Abstract:</b> Tactic latency is the time between
		when the tactic is started and when its effect is produced. Fortunately,
		many self-adaptive techniques are beginning to account for latency in their
		decision-making process. These adaptation processes consider tactic latency
		to be a static, human defined value. Unfortunately, many
		tactics have a volatile latency value; one that may be constantly changing.
		In this work, we present a Latency Volatility Aware (LVA) adaptation process.
		This paper advances the self-adaptive decision-making process by reducing tactic latency uncertainty.
		Our discoveries can serve as a foundation for future work in reducing uncertainty
		through understanding and accounting for tactic latency volatility.</p>
