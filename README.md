Tactic latency is the time between when the tactic is started and when its effect is produced. Fortunately, many self-adaptive techniques are beginning to account for latency in their decision-making process. These adaptation processes consider tactic latency to be a static, human defined value. Unfortunately, many tactics have a volatile latency value; one that may be constantly changing. In this work, we present a Latency Volatility Aware (LVA) adaptation process. This paper advances the self-adaptive decision-making process by reducing tactic latency uncertainty. Our discoveries can serve as a foundation for future work in reducing uncertainty through understanding and accounting for tactic latency volatility.
